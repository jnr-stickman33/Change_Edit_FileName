# Change_Edit_FileName
# Edit Tilte by utilasing Folder Titles
# C#

Program is a Fast way of renaming or editing file.

This program was use to Capture the Title of the Folder where all the Image was inside and then add the Folder title to the end of the Image Title. 

The Program will be running thru all the folder and content inside. 

e.g. Folder April 2019 / Jon's Wedding.jpg
-> Jon's Wedding April 2019.jpg 

This application was put together in a hurry and only used to rename 200k Image to give the more value information per file before it was injected into a "Data Capturing and Analytical Platform"

Best Practice is not always used, and the code is "As is" feel free to use.
